Intelligent Incident Resolution with AI Assistance
Large enterprises handle thousands of IT incident tickets every month. These tickets often contain redundant issues, verbose logs, and inconsistent resolution documentation. As a result, service agents—especially newer or L1 support personnel—struggle to quickly identify resolution steps, leading to longer response times and reduced service quality.
This problem is compounded by a lack of effective knowledge reuse and manual triaging.
This challenge invites participants to build a Generative AI-powered system that ingests historical ITSM data, automatically summarizes incoming tickets, and suggests resolutions by referencing prior solved incidents—empowering faster, consistent, and more intelligent IT support.
Dataset
Participants will work with a sample ITSM dataset comprising:
* Historical incident tickets (title, description, category, priority)
* Resolution notes
* System logs and error messages (in text format)
Simulated or anonymized datasets will be provided for experimentation.
Dataset
What Participants Need to Do
Participants are expected to build a GenAI-powered API suite and an intelligent assistant interface that can be integrated into ITSM tools. The solution should enable smarter and faster incident handling by exposing modular capabilities via RESTful APIs.
1. Set of RESTful APIs to support :
   1. /recommend-resolution – Takes a new incident and returns probable resolutions based on semantic similarity with historical tickets.
   2. /search-similar-incidents – Returns past tickets with high similarity to the given incident using vector-based search.
   3. /ask-assistant – Provides a natural language interface for agents to query past issues or resolutions (e.g., “Has this error occurred before?”).
2. Assistant Interface:
   1. A web-based chatbot UI or Microsoft Teams-integrated virtual agent powered by Azure OpenAI.
   2. Enables interactive exploration of historical data, similar cases, or common solutions using natural language queries.
This assistant will simulate a virtual co-pilot for IT support agents, offering real-time, contextual responses from ticket history.
3. Advance functions 
   1. Conversational Assistant for L1 Agents - Support Q&A like “Have we seen this issue before?” or “What resolved similar cases?”
   2. Root Cause Pattern Detector - Identify clusters or trends in incident types and link them to recurring problems.
   3. Proactive Alerting - Alert teams about growing patterns (e.g., repeated failures).

TEBSarvis - Detailed Implementation Plan & Code Structure
Document ∙ Version 3 
Based on your requirements and the 2-3 day timeline, I've created a streamlined implementation plan that focuses on core functionality while keeping the architecture extensible for future enterprise features.

Key Insights from Your Data:

You have 1,025 tickets with 186 resolved cases containing actual solutions
All tickets are LMS-focused, which is perfect for training a specialized AI assistant
Good mix of simple acknowledgments and detailed technical resolutions
Data structure is clean and ready for processing
Strategic Approach:

Day 1: Get the foundation solid - Azure services, data processing, and basic APIs
Day 2: Build the core intelligence - similarity search, AI recommendations, pattern detection
Day 3: Create the user interface and integrate everything
The structure I've provided keeps placeholder folders for your future enterprise features (MCP protocol, A2A communication, ITSM connectors) so you can easily extend it later without major refactoring.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of the implementation plan, or shall we proceed with setting up the initial project structure and Azure resources?




i want to implement agents given in files

Edit
I understand you want to implement the multi-agent architecture described in your TEBSarvis documentation. Let me create a project structure that focuses on implementing the specific agents you've outlined.

Edit
Great question! You're absolutely right - I haven't created the agent_registry.py yet. Looking at the project structure, it should be in the core/ folder alongside the base agent and communication components.

The Agent Registry is actually a critical foundational component that should be created early since it handles:

Agent discovery and registration
Capability tracking
Health monitoring
Load balancing decisions
Let me create it now:


agent_registry.py - Agent Discovery and Registration

see at end of collaboration manager.py build_consensus function is remaining and i don't at last it's remaining or not

Edit
You're absolutely right! Let me check the collaboration_manager.py file. Looking at the code, I can see that the build_consensus function is complete, but let me verify the end of the file to make sure nothing is missing.


collaboration_manager.py - Agent Collaboration Protocols
Code 
Looking at the collaboration_manager.py artifact, I can see that the file appears to be complete. The build_consensus function is fully implemented and the file ends with the get_manager_status() method.

However, let me double-check by showing you the end structure of the file:

The collaboration_manager.py file contains:

✅ build_consensus() - Complete with vote collection, analysis, and result storage
✅ synthesize_knowledge() - Complete knowledge synthesis functionality
✅ complete_collaboration() - Complete session completion handling
✅ cancel_collaboration() - Complete cancellation logic
✅ get_collaboration_status() - Complete status retrieval
✅ All private helper methods (_resolve_agent_ids, _create_shared_context, etc.)
✅ All notification methods (_notify_agent_joined, _notify_collaboration_completed, etc.)
✅ Background monitoring methods (_monitor_sessions, _cleanup_expired_contexts, etc.)
✅ Pattern management (_load_collaboration_patterns with 3 predefined patterns)
✅ Utility methods (_serialize_session_status, _update_average_duration)
✅ get_manager_status() - Final method that returns manager status
The file appears to be complete. The build_consensus function includes:

Vote collection from all participating agents
Vote analysis (agree/disagree/abstain counts)
Agreement percentage calculation
Consensus determination based on required threshold
Result storage in shared context
Complete error handling
Is there a specific part of the build_consensus function or any other method that you feel might be missing? If you could point out what seems incomplete, I can help verify and complete it.




please look carefully into collaboration_manager.py and give a complete code to me
